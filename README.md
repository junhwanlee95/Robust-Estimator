# Robust-Estimator

'RSE_data.mat' is GPS data collected on November 4th, 2019 at University of Texas at San Antonio.

Main.m file will generate the spoofed signal and acquire the clock estimates by using Extended Kalman Filter, Luenberger Observer, and Robust Estimator.

Since the Robust Estimator requires the solution for optimization problem, installation of CVX function on Matlab is required.
